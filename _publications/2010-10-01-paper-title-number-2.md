Analytics over urban video streams is well suited for dis-
tributed computing across Edge, Fog and Cloud. Such streams are net-
work intensive, making it is prohibitive to fully transfer them to the
Cloud. Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in im-
age classification, but are computationally costly on just Edge devices.
We propose ECHO as a big data platform to compose IoT dataflows
and seamlessly distribute them across Edge and Cloud resources. In this
demonstration, we illustrate the capabilities of ECHO for deploying sev-
eral video analytics applications to support smart city use-cases.

March 2018 was a month that had a deep impact on how the society looks at technology. The Cambridge Analytica scandal and, the fatality of a pedestrian after being mowed down by a self-driving Uber together spelled the dark side of technology. While the two incidents might seem disjoint, I'd say they have a common theme, a corporate giant exploiting the relatively fuzzy legalities governing upcoming technological advances. The former got widespread media coverage, while the latter seemed to be brushed under the carpet under the excuse of *accidents happen*. And yes, accidents do happen, but there's a thin line between accidents and negligence, which will be discussed as a part of this post. Note that I will quote facts from NTSB's [preliminary report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY18MH010-prelim.pdf), which by nature can change based on further findings.


Smart cities need smarter governments.

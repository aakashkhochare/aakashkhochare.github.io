I am currently a final year PhD candidate at the [DREAM Lab](http://dream-lab.cds.iisc.ac.in) in the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/) of the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/). 

My research interests include System Optimizations and Programming models for Machine learning at the edge, including mobile platforms such as drones. I am interested in optimizations for Serverless computing across the Edge, Fog, and Cloud Fabric.


*The DREAM:Lab team, led by me, won the IEEE TCSC SCALE Challenge 2019. [Read more](http://dream-lab.cds.iisc.ac.in/scale-2019/)*

I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [DREAM Lab](http://dream-lab.cds.iisc.ac.in) in the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/). While the broad scope of my work pertains to Distributed Systems, I am currently exploring system side requirements to support computer vision application for Internet of Things applications. As a consequence I am exposed to a variety of work on Smart Cities and Deep Learning as well.
